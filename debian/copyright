 This file is part of the source code for the DispHelper COM helper library.
 DispHelper allows you to call COM objects with an extremely simple printf style syntax.
 DispHelper can be used from C++ or even plain C. It works with most Windows compilers
 including Dev-CPP, Visual C++ and LCC-WIN32. Including DispHelper in your project
 couldn't be simpler as it is available in a compacted single file version.
 .
 Included with DispHelper are over 20 samples that demonstrate using COM objects
 including ADO, CDO, Outlook, Eudora, Excel, Word, Internet Explorer, MSHTML,
 PocketSoap, Word Perfect, MS Agent, SAPI, MSXML, WIA, dexplorer and WMI.
 .
 DispHelper is free open source software provided under the BSD license.
 .

 This file is the compacted single file version of the DispHelper COM helper library.
 DispHelper allows you to call COM objects with an extremely simple printf style syntax.
 DispHelper can be used from C++ or even plain C. It works with most Windows compilers
 including Dev-CPP, Visual C++ and LCC-WIN32. Including DispHelper in your project
 couldn't be simpler as it is available in a compacted single file version (this file).
 .
 Included with DispHelper are over 20 samples that demonstrate using COM objects
 including ADO, CDO, Outlook, Eudora, Excel, Word, Internet Explorer, MSHTML,
 PocketSoap, Word Perfect, MS Agent, SAPI, MSXML, WIA, dexplorer and WMI.
 .
 DispHelper is free open source software provided under the BSD license.
 .
 Find out more, browse the readable version of the source code
 and download DispHelper at:
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/disphelper/
 http://disphelper.sourceforge.net/
 .
 To use DispHelper in your project, include this file(disphelper.c) and the
 header (disphelper.h). For Visual C++, Borland C++ and LCC-Win32 import
 libraries are included via pragma directives. For other compilers you may
 need to add ole32, oleaut32 and uuid. To do this in Dev-CPP add
 "-lole32 -loleaut32 -luuid" to the linker box under Project->Project Options->Parameters.
 .
 If you are using Dev-CPP and get errors when compiling this file:
 Make sure this file is set to compile as C and not C++ under
 Project->Project Options->Files.
